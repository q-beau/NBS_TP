Practical Session: Soil Organic Carbon Modeling with RothC
-----------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the practical exercise on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics modeling.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Understand how climate scenarios affect SOC evolution
* Compare different crop rotation systems
* Analyze the impact of straw return on carbon sequestration
* Visualize long-term SOC trends with uncertainty quantification

**Exercise Structure:**

The exercise is organized in three main parts:

1. **Getting Started**: Prepare your workspace and your conda environment
2. **Main Script Documentation**: Explain the structure of the main script
3. **Instructions**: Explain the research questions to explore during the exercise
